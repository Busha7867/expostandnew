      question: 'Budget Wisely',
      answer: 'It goes without saying that you have to spend a small fortune on an exhibition stand, but at the same time, you cannot expect it to be presented at an excellent price. It would help if you kept in mind that budget considerations should also take into account the size and location of the exhibition space, transportation, accommodation, gifts, staff salaries, etc.'

      question: 'Book In Advance',
      answer: 'There are two very important reasons to book in advance: The first is to make sure you choose the best seat in the room. Location really makes a big difference, so dont risk being pushed back into a dark corner. Once you book and commit to an exhibition, you can view previous events, competition schedules, promotions, etc., to learn what to expect from the show.',

      question: 'Prepare Your Offer',
      answer: 'One of the biggest and most common mistakes in connection with an unsuccessful exhibition participation is not planning and preparing the appearance in advance. Before an exhibition, it is extremely important not only to define what you want to achieve but also to set very specific goals and describe how you want to achieve them. Its never a smart idea to approach this type of event without having a comprehensive strategy in place, from what you re offering to how you ll communicate it to your audience, materials, special offers, giveaways, and more.'
