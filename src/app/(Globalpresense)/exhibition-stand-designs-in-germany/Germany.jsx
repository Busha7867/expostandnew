Stand’s custom design is one of the best ways to ensure your experiential exhibit conveys your brand message. The entire design process for a custom stand includes design, manufacture, graphics, assembly, and disassembly. To make the most out of your custom exhibition stand, start the custom exhibit design process about a year in advance. From the age of six months, your design team will work out all your project details. Gilbert designers will develop a master theme or theme for your project and weave it into a custom display to say. A month of rest based on your feedback, they create the final “to-do list” and take care of the final details.</p>
